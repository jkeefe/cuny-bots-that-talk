Welcome to the Bots That Talk module! 

Bots that Talk: The art and code of conversational interfaces

## Description

The way we communicate with computers is becoming conversational. With chat interfaces or our voices, we're using natural language to ask our devices for information. And they're talking back. Advances in natural language processing, voice recognition and artificial intelligence are literally bringing this technology home -- and also making it easier for newcomers to build conversational "specialty" bots to fit specific needs. In this class, we will explore the emerging role of conversational bots in society (including journalism), the qualities that make a bot effective (or not) and the process making good bots. And we'll make our own. You will learn some code in this class, but previous coding experience is not necessary.

## Why We Need This Course

In the present-future, we will -- and do -- get more our information from conversational interfaces such as Alexa, Siri and OK Google. So media organizations and journalists should consider how these bots are becoming entry points to their content, and also how specialty bots may be useful to their journalists and their audience.

## What Students Will Come Away With

- Better understanding of the emergence of conversational interfaces
- The anatomy of bots (how they work and don't work)
- An overview of natural language processing and its role in bot creation
- A better understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Hands-on experience designing a conversational interface
- Hands-on technical experience making a bot
- Experience bringing editorial voice and human perspective to bots

## Logistics

### Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, tweet, chat or communicate with people outside the class while we're having class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

### Slack for Communications

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. 

Slack is also a great platform for experimentation and prototyping, and we'll be doing some of that, too.

Our Slack is [cunylab.slack.com](https://cunylab.slack.com)

### Github for Code

I'll post code, examples and and class documents on Github. If you have a Github account, great. If not, don't worry. You don't need it right away, as the GitHub info is public.

Our Github is [github.com/jkeefe/cuny-bots-that-talk](https://github.com/jkeefe/cuny-bots-that-talk)

## Activities

Each week's activities will be done, or started, in class. Activities done outside of class will get full credit. We'll use Slack or in-class review to determine if it's completed. 

## Grading

There are 100 points possible in this class, and participation is key.

* **Attendance:** 10 points each class. Attend and you get the points. Note that there are no "excused" absences. We only meet 5 times. Every class counts.
* **Activities:** 10 points for each class. Most of these activities will happen -- or begin -- in class. Complete them, and you get 10 points. If you are not in class, and complete them anyway, you get the points.

The grading scale is based on the following:

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

But given that you get points in multiples of 10, there are really just five possible grades:  

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 100 |  A+ |
| 90 | A- |
| 80 | B- |
| 70 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Plagiarism

This is a journalism class; truth, facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources, or each other, be sure to include acknowledgement to that work. If it's code, even open-source coded, include links back to that code and any applicable licenses.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

When working on teams, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.
